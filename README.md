# HW1_JusongCai

In this homework #1, I will follow along with Making a PIC32 circuit from scratch to build and test my breadboard PIC32 circuit. Also in this HW1 folder, files include code, demo video, pictures and so on.

In folder "HW1.X", some make files and exe files are not uploaded along their directories, this may cause some confusion. If you need those compile files, tell me and I will upload them in other ways. But the main code named "commit1.c" and "commit2.c" is good and accessible.
